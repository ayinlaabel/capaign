            <p>Permit me to allow James share his personal experience and testimonies. James suffered bad breath for so
                long and
                was full of the frustration of not being able to find a solution – until now. He had no idea how to
                solve his
                bad breath problem either, until he stumbled on an incredibly effective and all-natural solution.</p>
            <p>My name is James, “Let me tell you how my bad breath nightmare started…”</p>
            <p>I worked as an Intern at a multi-national as a support staff, I am very good at my job, but as time went
                by, I
                noticed that I was always getting a sharp and quick response from those I worked with and those I
                provide
                support to, some of them give me some distance whenever they wanted to talk to me.</p>
            <p>I couldn’t make friends because everyone was just too official with me and they were very brief at
                talking to me.
                Nobody could tell me what the issue was that they noticed in me, but one faithful day, my boss walked up
                to me
                and asked me to see him in her office, allas she told me, she said, my dear, I don’t mean to embarrass
                you, but
                I must just tell you the truth, your mouth stinks, I think you have bad breadth.
            </p>
            <p>I felt like the ground should open up and swallow me, I felt so ashamed of myself, I just summoned
                courage and
                told her thank you ma and left her office.</p>
            <p>After that conversation with my boss when I got home I bought mouth wash, I washed my mouth with it
                several times
                daily, I brushed and wash my tongue three times daily yet I did not get the needed result.</p>
            <p>I went to the dentists for help, I only got reprimands, they said I should wash my mouth several times
                daily, I
                did not get much help there.</p>
            <p>I was almost thinking my stepmother had bewitched me until I found a leaflet on the seating desk of a
                shopping
                mall, apparently, it must have been given to someone who left it there before I got there. And guess
                what I
                found when I opened it….</p>
            <h3>REMEDY TO YOUR BAD BREATH…</h3>
            <p>My eyes popped open, I looked left and right to be sure that someone who knew me did not put it there, I
                moved to
                a corner and read every single information I found on the paper, I took my phone and called the number
                given and
                that was the beginning of the solution to my bad breath</p>
            <p>I discovered an incredibly effective remedy for my bad breath, and it was 100% safe and natural!</p>
            <p>Within just minutes, my breath was noticeably fresher and cleaner – and more importantly, my “Dragon
                Breath”
                hasn’t returned since.</p>
            <p>As soon as I was confident enough that this remedy worked all the time, I started sharing it with other
                bad
                breath sufferers.</p>
            <p>And every single one of them has experienced incredible results.</p>
            <h5>AND NOW YOU CAN TOO!</h5>
            <p>This natural remedy is also known to work for the following;</p>

                to see the dentist in the future…</p>
