    <p>Permit me to allow James share his personal experience and testimonies. James suffered bad breath for so long and was full of the frustration of not being able to find a solution – until now. He had no idea how to solve his bad breath problem either, until he stumbled on an incredibly effective and all-natural solution.</p>
    <p>My name is James, “Let me tell you how my bad breath nightmare started…”</p>
    <p>I worked as an Intern at a multi-national as a support staff, I am very good at my job, but as time went by, I noticed that I was always getting a sharp and quick response from those I worked with and those I provide support to, some of them give me some distance whenever they wanted to talk to me.</p>
    <p>I couldn’t make friends because everyone was just too official with me and they were very brief at talking to me. Nobody could tell me what the issue was that they noticed in me, but one faithful day, my boss walked up to me and asked me to see him in her office, allas she told me, she said, my dear, I don’t mean to embarrass you, but I must just tell you the truth, your mouth stinks, I think you have bad breadth. 
    </p>
    <p>I felt like the ground should open up and swallow me, I felt so ashamed of myself, I just summoned courage and told her thank you ma and left her office.</p>
    <p>After that conversation with my boss when I got home I bought mouth wash, I washed my mouth with it several times daily, I brushed and wash my tongue three times daily yet I did not get the needed result.</p>
